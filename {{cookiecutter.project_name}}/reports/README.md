# Reports

The reports directory can be used to store all kinds of (intermediate)
reports about the project. From figures that you presented at group 
meetings to presentations given at conferences. 

Tip for the meeting directory: If you create a subdirectory for each
meeting with the date in `YYMMDD` format, they will be nicely ordered
by time in your directory listing.
