# Paper

In the paper directory, you can write your (LaTeX) paper. Many people
use Overleaf these days and it is possible to use git version control
to sync your paper files with Overleaf.

Please see the [Git integration](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Git_integration)
manual of Overleaf to get your Overleaf project into this directory.
